Below is a ready-to-use Markdown one-pager tailored for GPT-Codex to convert into the site design.
It includes small inline design hints (as HTML comments) so the generator can reuse the existing site styles (colors, fonts, spacing, header/nav) and keep the minimal, whitespace-forward aesthetic you asked for.

Copy this whole file into your editor / prompt for GPT-Codex.

The Gap Between Idea and Product Stops Here

For GPT-Codex (developer notes)
	•	Use existing site tokens: colors, fonts, spacing, header/nav, and existing logo assets.
	•	Responsive rules: Single-column mobile; two-column hero on desktop. Keep the page very sparse with large margins.
	•	Interaction:
	•	Primary CTA should open a chat widget or deep-link to WhatsApp/Telegram if available.
	•	Secondary CTA opens a calendar scheduling modal (use Calendly or your current scheduling tool).
	•	Form submissions must trigger a friendly auto-reply with next steps.
	•	Accessibility: semantic headings, accessible form labels, keyboard-focus styles.
	•	Performance: lazy-load any images, avoid heavy scripts. Keep bundle minimal.

⸻

If you want, I can now:
	•	produce a slim HTML + Tailwind version of this Markdown ready for your Svelte site, or
	•	generate the 3 outreach messages (LinkedIn DM, cold email, Slack message) that use this page as the landing place.

Which of those should I produce next?
