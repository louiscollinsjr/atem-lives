## The challenge

Soundcraftâ€™s founders wanted to validate their concept without investing in a full-blown native application. They needed a responsive, audio-centric web app ready for beta creators.

## Our approach

- Built real-time rooms powered by WebRTC with moderation controls.
- Delivered a CMS-driven event schedule so creators could program weekly sessions.
- Trained the founders to read metrics via PostHog dashboards configured during the build.

## Launch impact

- 600 creators requested invites within two weeks.
- 40% of early testers hosted more than one session within the first month.
