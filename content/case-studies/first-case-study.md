## Overview

Civic’s founding team knew their idea would work if they could get the first launch right. We joined as a product partner to translate their research into an MVP that would engage early adopters.

## Highlights

- Defined the core flows around neighborhood alerts and community updates.
- Delivered a marketing-friendly landing experience with tailored messaging.
- Coached the Civic team on how to maintain their design system as they grew.

## Key Outcomes

- 1,500 new signups in the first 48 hours.
- A follow-on engagement to build admin tooling based on launch feedback.
