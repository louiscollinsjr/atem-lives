## We are hyperlocal engagement.

Satchel AR embodies the future of hyperlocal engagement, leveraging cutting-edge augmented reality (AR) technology and the innovative IOTA and Shimmer Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) networks. Our platform creates an immersive ecosystem where the physical and digital worlds converge, transforming how communities interact, businesses engage, and value is exchanged at the most local level.



### Mission

With us, every street corner around the world becomes a potential treasure trove, every local shop a gateway to exclusive experiences that can be shared globally, and every user interaction a step towards a more connected global community. We're reshaping the landscape of local commerce and social interaction in the Web3 era, powered by cutting-edge DAG technology, while fostering a sense of global unity through hyperlocal engagement.

Join our global movement to strengthen local economies and create meaningful connections across the world, one community at a time.
